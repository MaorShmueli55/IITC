        <h2>About the Website</h2>
        <p>This movie website was built as part of a project to showcase popular and top-rated films. The site integrates with the TMDB API to fetch real-time data, providing users with access to a wide variety of movies. Visitors can explore movie details, see their ratings, and read a short description. The goal is to create an interactive and visually appealing platform for film enthusiasts to discover new content.</p>
